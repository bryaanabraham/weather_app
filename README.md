# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

This project is my starting point for a Flutter application. I used the assistance if the online youtube course by Rivaan Ranawat to create this basic flutter weather application.
The course can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzRQ9mnmh44&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat
I have left a lot of room for improvement and will work on it as and when i gain more knowledge of flutter and front end development.
The app shows up the live weather data of a fixed location along with the forecast at given time stamps.

Improvements to work on:
- display active location
- incorporate unit conversion
- detailed information on click
- light/dark mode accesilbility
- overall user interface tweaks
