# weather_app

#### A new Flutter project.

This project is my starting point for a Flutter application. I used the assistance if the online youtube course by Rivaan Ranawat to create this basic flutter weather application.
The course can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzRQ9mnmh44&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat<br><br>
I recognize that there's room for improvement, and I'm committed to actively enhancing my skills in Flutter and front-end development. I'll proactively work on these areas as I continue to gain more knowledge.
