# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

This project is my starting point for a Flutter application. I used the assistance if the online youtube course by Rivaan Ranawat to create this basic flutter weather application.
The course can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzRQ9mnmh44&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat
I have left room for improvement and will work on it as and when i gain more knowledge of flutter and front end development.
The app shows up the live weather data of a fixed location along with the forecast at given time stamps.

App's working:
- The app provides with the live weather status of the chosen location (city).
- The app also shows you the predicted forecast of the entire day in terms of cloudy or sunny with the temperature.
- The app give additional information about the current humidity, windspeed and pressure of the chosen loaction
- The app works in both light and dark mode; furthermore it automatically switches from light to dark mode after sunset and vice versa at sunrise.
- The refresh icon allows you to refresh the data.

Scope of Improvement:
I intend to incorporate the following changes at the earliest
- display active location
- animated widget cards which open up to provide additional information about the forecast on click
- animated background
- additional information will be accessible on scroll
- auto refresh every minute
- allow unit conversions
